# My Google Summer of Code 2021 Application for Dask.

# Application Template

You should include the following information in your application. You should *not* format your application as a question/answer format for the below questions, but we expect to see all of the above questions answered in your application somewhere.

## Title

Please use a succinct title that describes your proposal.

## You the person

* Your full name

* University / current enrollment

* Short bio / overview of your background

* How can we contact you?

  - Email
  - GitHub username
  - Any other username you want us to know about

## You the programmer

In your project proposal let us know about your programming experience.

* What is your experience programming? Tell us about something you have created.

* What is your experience with Python?

* Have you ever used git or another version control system? Do you have experience using GitHub?

* What is your experience with Open Source? Have you ever contributed to another open source project?

## Project Description

Answer the following questions in your application:

* What do you want to achieve?

* What excites you about this project? Why did you choose it?

* What qualifications do you have to implement your idea? Why are you suited to work on this project?

* How much time do you plan to invest in the project before, during, and after the Summer of Code? (we will expect full time 40h/week during GSoC). If you plan to take any vacations over the summer, let us know about it here.

* How will you break your project into smaller tasks? Please provide a schedule of how time will be spent on sub-tasks of the project over the GSoC development period. While we will not hold you to this schedule, this lets us know that you have thought about how to break the project into smaller tasks and will help us monitor your progress throughout the summer.

  Please also note in the schedule where could formulate a pull request. These would be points where you can have a self contained, documented, and tested piece of functionality. Doing this at several points during the summer helps to keep code reviews manageable. A big pull request at the end of the summer will likely be hard to review and merge before the project deadline.

## Pull Request Requirement

Please provide a brief summary of your contributions to Dask so far, including unmerged work. You must include at least one link showing that you satisfied this requirement.
