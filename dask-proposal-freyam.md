## Project Description

### Motivation

### Objective

### Tech Stack

### Deliverables

- The code will be off the highest quality standards, having detailed documentation (`Sphinx`), code styling (`black`), and will be thoroughly tested.
- A detailed, well-documented tutorial will be developed during the summers' implementation of almost every feature of Visualization to help developers as a reference.
- One blog each week (Around 15) regarding Dask, Python, and my experience, learning through the project on Visualizing Performance Flow.
- For the community to track progress, I will maintain a tracker with my latest developments containing weekly updates and MoM of mentor meetings. This will help strengthen accountability and transparency from my end.

## Project Breakdown

Three well-defined goals that determine project status which will help in the evaluation are as follows:

### Evaluation 1

### Evaluation 2

### Final Evaluation

<br />

## Project Timeline

Below is my timeline for the completion of the project. This is meant as more of an outline for what order I will complete the project, rather than a raw week-by-week breakdown (as in, some weeks may blend into each other). A more detailed schedule (after gaining an in-depth understanding of technologies used) will be planned during the pre-GSoC and community bonding period and shared with the mentor.

Regardless, I will have at least one deliverable at the end of each week to be evaluated.

I do not have any other commitments during the summer. I am lucky that the GSoC timeline works perfectly with my course schedule as well. So, I will not be busy with coursework during the GSoC period, and I can sincerely commit to the timeline I have illustrated below.
If something comes up, I will inform my mentor a week before and limit my unavailability to not more than two days. I am willing to adjust and re-plan the timings as per mentor/admin availability and any unknown requirements in the future.

Each week, time will be divided (according to workload) amongst planning, learning, coding, documenting, and testing features. Except for the developer’s guide, all documentation will go hand in hand with the development. This will help keep a profound grasp of the code implementation and working, minimizing bugs in later stages. Weekends will be primarily dedicated to testing, bug fixing, and blog writing. Fortnightly blogs will be maintained at https://medium.com/@freyam and will include highlights of the development process and methods used to overcome hurdles.

- Weekdays (Monday to Friday): **5 - 6 hours** (**+ 2 hours**)
- Weekends (Saturday and Sunday): **4 - 5 hours** (**+ 3 hours**)
- Cummulative (Monday to Sunday) **33 - 40 hours** (**+ 16 hours**)

You can always find me active on Slack/Email/Github/Gitter between 7:00 AM (3:00 AM UTC) and 11:55 PM (7:55 PM UTC). I will be available for communication at all times decided by my mentor and discuss new ideas and methods throughout the project.

### Pre GSoC (now - May 16th)

- Make more contributions through fixing issues over the Dask ecosystem and adding features to further bolster my understanding of the codebase and the scope of the `visualize()` method.
- Brush up on all the necessary topics for the libraries to wrap my mind around Dask, Python and JavaScript libraries like `cytoscape`, `d3-graphviz`, and `ipyelk`.
- Along with that, I’ll carry on my experiments and demos with various technologies being used to gain a deeper understanding of the same.
- Get more familiar with the operational workflow of Dask.

### Community Bonding (May 17th - June 7th)

- I want to be sure I will be spending time implementing the features I would like to, instead of second-guessing myself later about the design choices I have made.
- The main focus in this period will be to frame a roadmap for the project with the mentor's guidance (along with improving bonding, which is what the period is for).
- I will also use this period to study the already present work on `visualize()` and to figure a concrete plan to integrate the new features.
- I will frame the integration of various parts of the project into one another, and a source code directory layout will be prepared to keep the flow smooth in later stages of the development.

## My Commitment

During and after the project, I will help solve more significant challenges and bugs faced in other Dask projects, wherever the community needs my help. I’m very enthusiastic about taking up issues (outside my GSoC project) as and when time permits.
I will remain an active contributor to the Dask Ecosystem, taking part in discussions for future projects, implementations, and bugs. There are several miscellaneous non-code tasks that I would like to take up to give back to the community, such as mentoring and representing the same in global conferences. Maybe if the community agrees, also mentor someone else in the foreseeable future.

## Why I am suited for this project?

I am aptly suited for this project because,

- I have the technical skills required to complete this project: Python and JavaScript, with which I am experienced enough to tackle any problems that I might come across.
- I am willing to learn anything that this project demands, and I believe within time, I can pick up any skill.
- Being in my freshman year, I will be easily dedicating all of my time to the project. I can easily stick to the timeline I have laid out.
- Being new to the development community, I can bring a unique and fresh perspective to the project and Dask.

I have been contributing solely to Dask for the past two weeks, and with the constant support of mentors, I have engaged long enough with the project that I’m crystal clear about the objectives of this project. After coming up with well-thought ideas and preparing an actionable plan to achieve them, I am confident that I can finish the project within the proposed timeline. I will be thrilled to be a part of Dask this Summer (and even later) to evolve as a developer.

## About Me

I am **Freyam Mehta**, a Computer Science fresher at **International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India**. I have been fascinated by programming since I was 15. I am passionate about finding clean and creative solutions to all kinds of problems through my skills and talent. My current interests include UI/UX Designing, Data Structures and Algorithms, Data Science, Machine Learning Applications and, Open Source Development.

I enjoy playing team sports (Cricket, Basketball, and Volleyball), writing, singing, and dancing. I also like spending time contributing back to society. Check out my dream project, [The Climate Synergy](https://www.instagram.com/theclimatesynergy/), to know more.

### Relevant Programming Experience

I have a firm knowledge of C, C++, Python and a basic acquaintance with web-development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am amazed by how Python has overtaken almost all other languages in every development sector due to its simplicity and lesser development time. Python gives the developers the freedom to spend more time on innovation and less time on the actual implementation, a significant distinguisher from languages like C. I love the fact that Python is such a universal language that has so much to offer. I have worked on two fairly complex Python Deep Learning projects on Image Classification using Deep Neural Networks:

1. I love cats. So, I made a Cat Classifier which implements and trains an L-layer Neural Network to classify cats vs. non-cat images by using Logistic Regression and storing a cache to pass information from forward to backpropagation ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/freyam/image-classification-of-cats-using-a-neural-network)).
2. After the successful Cat Classifier, I tried my hands on a Number Sign Classifier which implements and trains a Deep Neural Network in Tensorflow to classify number signs by using Logistic Regression and applying optimization methods such as (Stochastic) Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/freyam/image-classification-of-numbers-using-a-neural-network)).

I have also worked extensively with Front-end Development (HTML5/CSS/JS):

1. Classic games like Tic-Tac-Toe ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/freyam/tic-tac-toe)) and Number Guessing ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/freyam/number-guessing-game)).

2. I have cloned a website from [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4). I tweaked around a bit and customized the website to my taste. I learned so much in this process as I worked with live code, and I had full control over the output. You can find my website [https://freyam.netlify.app](https://freyam.netlify.app) hosted on GitHub ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/freyam/my-website)).

I love to learn by doing. When I joined Dask, I was confused at the start. So, I thought of using it somewhere myself. Since I was spending so much time on the GSoC organizations list, I built a simple python scraper using Pandas DataFrame. Then, I used Dask to attain the same results. This also helped me understand the need for the Issue [#1259](https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/1259) - To implement Pandas' methods in Dask.

I have always worked diligently on things I have fun at. I perform well when I am having fun, and Dask is exactly that. The past two weeks have been so much fun, and I cannot wait to start working on the project!

### Open Source Experience

I have been using GitHub for maintaining all my projects for over a year now. I have worked on my college clubs' projects on GitHub, and I am confident about the version control workflow which goes around in large codebases.

This is not the first time I have been part of an Open Source Community. I was intrigued by the concept for a long time and started from my school days. Open Source contributions have made me realize the importance of a well documented and easy-to-understand code. I have participated in 2 editions of Google Code-in (precursor to GSOC) in 2018 and 2019 and have contributed documentation and designs to well known organizations like [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/), [LibreHealth](https://librehealth.io/), [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/) and [CCExtractor](https://www.ccextractor.org/). I have also taken part in the Hacktoberfest 2021 and am an active member of the OSDG@IIIT-H club, and have conducted Open Source Workshops in my college.

<br />

This will be my first time contributing to a robust and complex codebase like yours. Although it is my first time with Dask, the things I have picked up in the last two weeks have been unimaginable for me. I have learned about Parallel workloads using Dask, lazy computing, Sphinx documentation, multiple data visualization libraries (`cytoscape`, `d3-graphviz`, `ipyelk`, and more) and what not! I am thrilled to take this learning journey even further by working on the project.

I want to mention that I am a curiosity-driven learner. All the programming knowledge I have gained so far results from my endless exploration & self-learning capabilities. I do not hesitate to learn new stuff if it piques my interest.

I must mention that it has been a great learning experience contributing to Dask. One of the reasons I have been active in Dask is the immensely constructive community, and I’ll try to keep myself updated with other developments. More than anything, I find this project super fun to work with. The community was very helpful in getting me started with the development tasks. Special shoutout to Madhumitha Paul ([@Madhu94](https://github.com/Madhu94)) for showing me the right way and being a fantastic friend.

This project is inspiring to me because it will give me exposure to Dask's codebase and increase my understanding of the inner workings of Python and, specifically, how great visualization can be so crucial.
