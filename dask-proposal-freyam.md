## Project Description

### Motivation

### Objective

### Tech Stack

### Deliverables

- The code will be off the highest quality standards, having detailed documentation (Sphinx), code styling (`black`, `flake8`, and `isort`), and will be thoroughly tested.
- A detailed, well-documented tutorial will be developed during the summers' implementation of almost every feature of Visualization to help developers as a reference.
- One blog each week (Around 15) regarding Dask, Python, and my experience, learning through the project on Visualizing Code Flow.
- For the community to track progress, I will maintain a tracker with my latest developments containing weekly updates and MoM of mentor meetings. This will help strengthen accountability and transparency from my end.

## Project Breakdown

Three well-defined goals that determine project status which will help in the evaluation are as follows:

### Evaluation 1

### Evaluation 2

### Final Evaluation

## Project Timeline

Below is my timeline for the completion of the project. I have reserved the weekend for solving the issues that I might run into at different stages of the project. As the project progresses, I will adjust this schedule as appropriate. Additionally, this is meant as more of an outline for what order I will complete the project, rather than a raw week-by-week breakdown (as in, some weeks may blend into each other). A more detailed schedule (after gaining in-depth understanding of technologies used) will be planned during the pre-GSoC and community bonding period and shared with the mentor.

Regardless, I will have at least one deliverable at the end of each week to be evaluated.

I do not have any other commitments during the summer. I am lucky that the GSoC timeline works perfectly with my course schedule as well. So, I am not busy with coursework during the GSoC period, and I can sincerely commit to the timeline I have illustrated below.
If something comes up, I will inform my mentor a week before and limit my unavailability to not more 2 days. I am willing to adjust and re-plan the timings as per mentor/admin availability and any unknown requirements in the future.

Each week, time will be divided (according to workload) amongst planning, learning, coding, documenting and testing features. Except for the developer’s guide, all documentation will go hand in hand with the development. This will help to keep a profound grasp over the code implementation and working, minimizing bugs in the later stages.

Weekends will be mostly dedicated to testing, bug fixing, and blog writing. Fortnightly blogs will be maintained at https://medium.com/@freyam and will include highlights of the development process and also methods used to overcome hurdles.

- Weekdays (Monday to Friday): **5 - 6 hours** (**+ 2 hours**)
- Weekends (Saturday and Sunday): **4 - 5 hours** (**+ 3 hours**)
- Cummulative (Monday to Sunday) **33 - 40 hours** (**+ 16 hours**)

One of the reasons I’ve been active in Dask is due to the immensely helpful community and I’ll try to keep myself continuously updated with other developments going on. I’ll be available for communication at all times decided by my mentor and discuss new ideas and methods throughout the project.

### Pre GSoC (now - May 16th)

- Make more contributions through fixing advanced issues and adding features to further bolster my understanding of the codebase and the scope of the `visualize()` method.
- Brush up all the necessary topics for the libraries to wrap my mind around Dask (`cytoscape`, `d3-graphviz`, and `ipyelk`).
- Get more familiar with the operational workflow of the project.

### Community Bonding (May 17th - June 7th)

- Communicate with the mentors on different ideas for the image processing stuff and get input on how it can be integrated in a user friendly way.
- Communicate with other selected applicants about their projects and how we can be of help to each other.
- Keep working on issues and start working on wrapping OpenCV library.
- I want to be sure I will be spending time implementing the features I would like to, instead of second-guessing myself later about the design choices I have made.

## My Commitment

- Contribute more - After and during the project, I will help in solving bigger challenges and bugs faced in other Dask projects, wherever my help is needed by the community. I’m very enthusiastic about taking up issues (outside my GSoC project) as and when time permits.
- Complete Misc. Tasks - There are several miscellaneous non-code tasks that I would like to take up in the favor of giving back to the community such as mentoring and representing the same in global conferences.
- Remain as an active contributor to Scrapy and Python Software Foundation, taking part in discussions for the future projects, implementations, and bugs. Maybe if the community agrees, also mentor someone else in the foreseeable future.

## Why I am suited for this project?

I am aptly suited for this project because I have the technical skills required to complete this project: Python and JavaScript, with which I am experienced enough to tackle any problems that I might come across. Moreover, I am willing to learn anything that this project demands, and I believe within time, I can pick up any skill. Further, being a freshman, I will be easily able to dedicate all of my time to this. Lastly, being new to the development community, I can bring a unique and fresh perspective to the project and Dask.

I have been contributing solely to Dask for the past two weeks, and with the constant support of mentors, I have engaged long enough with the project that I’m crystal clear about the objectives of this project. After coming up with well-thought ideas and preparing an actionable plan to achieve them, I am confident that I can finish the project within the proposed timeline. I will be thrilled to be a part of Dask this Summer (and even later) to evolve as a developer.

## About Me

I am **Freyam Mehta**, a Computer Science fresher at **International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India**. I have been fascinated by programming since I was 15.I am passionate about finding clean and creative solutions to all kinds of problems through my skills and talent. My current interests include UI/UX Designing, Data Structures and Algorithms, Data Science, Machine Learning Applications and, Open Source Development.

I enjoy playing team sports (Cricket, Basketball, and Volleyball), writing, singing, and dancing. I also like spending time contributing back to society. Check out my dream project, The Climate Synergy, to know more.

### Relevant Programming Experience

I am proficient in Python/C++/HTML/JavaScript and many other languages.
<python>

### Open Source Experience

I have been using GitHub for maintaining all my personal projects for over an year now. I have worked on my college clubs' projects on GitHub and I am confident about the version control workflow which goes around in large codebases.

This is not the first time I have been part of an Open Source Community. I was intrigued by the concept for a long time and started from my school days. I have participated in 2 editions of Google Code-in (precursor to GSOC) in 2018 and 2019 and have contributed documentation and designs to well known organizations like [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/), [LibreHealth](https://librehealth.io/), [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/) and [CCExtractor](https://www.ccextractor.org/). I have also taken part in the Hacktoberfest and am an active member of the OSDG@IIIT-H club and have conducted Open Source Workshops in my college.

This will be my first time contributing to a robust and complex code base like yours. Although it's my first time with Dask, the things I have picked up in the last 2 weeks have been unimaginable for me. I have learned about Parallel workloads using Dask, lazy computing, Sphinx documentation, multiple data visualization libraries (`cytoscape`, `d3-graphviz`, `ipyelk`, and more) and what not! I am thrilled to take this learning journey even further working on the mentioned project.

I would like to mention that I am a curiosity-driven learner. All the programming knowledge I have gained so far, is the result of my endless exploration & self-learning capabilities. I do not hesitate in learning new stuff if it piques my interest; the same resulted in development of a simple GSoC Organizations Scrapper which scrapes the data from [GSoC Archive](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/)

You can alway find me active on the following platforms between 7AM and 11:55PM (UTC + 4:00):

I must mention that it has been a great learning experience contributing to Dask. The community was very helpful in getting me started with the development tasks. Special shoutout to [@Madhu94](https://github.com/Madhu94) for showing me the right way.

This project is inspiring to me because it will give me exposure to Dask's codebase and increase my understanding of the inner workings of Python and, specifically, how great visualization can be so crucial.
